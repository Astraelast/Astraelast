Hi üëã My name is **Astrael**  

**Ethical Hacker | Red Team Member**  

I‚Äôm a passionate ethical hacker and red team enthusiast with a deep commitment to securing systems through advanced penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and adversary emulation. My journey started with a curiosity for technology and has evolved into a mission to master skills like exploit development, network security analysis, and post-exploitation techniques. I thrive on uncovering weaknesses before they can be exploited, designing robust defenses, and staying ahead of modern threats.
